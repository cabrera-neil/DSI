    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a powerful resampling method that allows us to estimate our degree of uncertainty about practically any statistic. The beauty of bootstrapping is that it's done directly from the data without needing any assumptions about the distribution of our statistic!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many variations on the bootstrap. In this lesson, we'll only cover the classic **nonparametric bootstrap**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bootstrapping the Confidence Interval of a Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we wanted to calculate the 95% confidence interval around a statistic such as our sample mean. We could do this using the formula derived based on the central limit theorm (CLT), selecting z-scores along the normal distribution that correspond to our confidence level and multiplying them by our standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonparametric bootstrap procedure, on the other hand, does not rely on distributional assumputions of the parameter. Below is pseudocode describing the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for specified number of bootstrap iterations\n",
    "    create a bootstrap sample by randomly selecting observations with replacement from your sample \n",
    "        (same size as sample)\n",
    "    calculate the statistic of interest on bootstrap sample\n",
    "\n",
    "calculate lower and upper percentile bounds of bootstrap statistics according to threshold\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the 95% confidence threshold would mean we'd calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrapped sample means."

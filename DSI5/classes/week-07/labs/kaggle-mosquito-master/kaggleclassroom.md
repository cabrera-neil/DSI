> The following guide is for instructors to help set up their own Kaggle Competitions.

If you decide to create your own Kaggle Competition rather than participating in the Kaggle West Nile competition, you can do so via [https://inclass.kaggle.com](https://inclass.kaggle.com).

Setup is relatively self-explanetory, but there are a few important things to note:

1. As students donâ€™t have a universal email domain, you will be unable to create an entirely private competition.
  - **Workaround**: If desired, you can simply avoid posting the associated dataset to your new competition, as it is not a requirement. Instead, you could send it directly to your class.

2. You will need to upload your target column as a CSV, as well as a solution example (they can be the same file if you want).
  - Important to note: your target file needs to have both a target column and an ID/index column.  The columns must be named, although you can name them whatever you want and map them manually.

3. Use the `Preview` and `Overview` tabs to view and make final edits. Any big issues will be flagged in the `Overview` section.
  - Once the competition has been completed, you need to submit it for approval by an actual Kaggle admin.  This could take a few days, so you should set up the competition well in advance.

## Materials We Provide

<!--- This section is a table of contents for the activity. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between  notebooks and supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lab/Activity |  Structured Jupyter notebook with activity requirements and prompts | [Link](./practice-postgres-sql.ipynb)|
| Data | Northwind Database | Data on AWS|
| Solutions | Sample solutions to Jupyter notebook| [Link](./solution-code/practice-postgres-sql-solutions.ipynb)|

> Dataset(s) description: The Northwind Database is a famous database of sales data. General Assembly stores the SQL database on an AWS instance that students will access in the Juyter notebook.

## Prerequisites

<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites; in other words, what do students need to know to be able to benefit and perform the tasks required in this activity/lab? List all relevant skills or prior learning objectives --->

**Before this activity, students should already be able to**:

- Perform basic SQL queries.

---

## Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the activity or lab.  --->

This lab is meant to give students the chance to practice simple SQL `SELECT` statements and reading SQL data into Pandas.

<!--- This section lists the exact requirements students have to perform in order to "complete" the activity.  --->

### Requirements and Suggested Timing

> Total Time Required: 90 mins.

1. Inspect the Database (5 mins.)
    - Write a `SELECT` statement that lists all tables in the public schema of the Northwind database, sorted alphabetically
2. Print the Schemas (5 mins.)
3. Table Peek (5 mins.)
    - Display only the first three rows
4. Investigate the Products (30 mins)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: what categories fo products does the company sell? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: How many products per category does its catalog contain? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: How many products per category have not been discontinued? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: What are the five most expensive products (that haven't been discontinued)? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: How many units of each of these five products are in stock? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL and Pandas to answer: How would you construct a bar chart of the data with `pandas`? (5 mins.)
5. Investigate the Orders (45 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: How many orders are there in total? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: How many orders are there per year? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: How many orders are there per quarter? (5 mins.)
      - Make a line plot of the data as well. (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: Which country receives the most orders? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: Which country receives the least? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: What's the average shipping time? (5 mins.)
    - Use a SQL query to answer: Which customer is submitting the most orders? (5 mins.)
    - Which customer is generating the most revenue? (5 mins.)

<!--- If there are any bonus objectives, list them here. Bonus objectives are items that are not officially required in order to "complete" a given activity, but are provided as suggested enrichment for students who want additional challenges.--->

### Bonus

4. Use a SQL query to answer: What fraction of revenue is generated by the top five customers?

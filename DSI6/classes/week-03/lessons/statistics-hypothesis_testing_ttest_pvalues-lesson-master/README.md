## Materials We Provide

<!--- This section is a table of contents for the lesson. The table structure breaks down typical lesson resources into types, distinguishing between lesson notebooks and other supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | Interactive jupyter notebook with structured lesson content | [Link](./frequentist-hypothesis-testing-ttests-pvalues.ipynb)|
| Solutions | Solution code to lesson notebook | [Link](./solution-code/frequentist-hypothesis-testing-ttests-pvalues-solution.ipynb)|

## Learning Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the lesson. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, see: http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/ --->

*After this lessons, students will be able to:*

- Understand the fundamental concepts of Frequentist hypothesis testing.
- Understand the difference between the null and alternative hypotheses.
- Understand the t-statistic, p-value, and t-test.
- Calculate the t-statistic and p-value by hand.
- Visually represent the t-test and p-value using the t-distribution.
- Understand how the t-test and Frequentist hypothesis testing relate to the concepts of signal and noise.

## Additional Resources

<!--- This section lists useful reference materials that can inform, extend, or deepen a student's understanding of the material. While this may seem like a "nice to have" feature, we normally see a range of advanced and remedial students in our classes. Curating these resources allows us to provide targeted materials and suggestions that instructors can use to support different student needs. --->

> Note: The following is a Markdown formatted readme file of [this Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10MQB-CR_IQl3-z1HpxGKCrScKb94uj53FvQkssX9KBw/edit?usp=sharing) that should be sent to students by local teams upon signing up for the course.

## REQUIRED TOOLS
Before the course starts, you may want to familiarize yourself with the following technologies:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - We will be using Anaconda as our primary development environment.
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - We will be using Python & its packages as our primary language.
* [Github](http://github.com) - We’ll be using Github on a daily basis to store and share our code.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (mac) / [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io) (pc) - You will also need to install Git command line tools for your OS.
* [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) - We’ll be using Postgres for local SQL-based data storage.
* [Slack](http://slack.com) - We’ll be using Slack on a daily basis to communicate with each other.

## COMMON TOOLS
Anaconda bundles many of the Python packages we’ll be using, including:

* **Python 2.7**: The most widely used, stable, enterprise version of Python.
* **Ipython / Jupyter**  & **Pandas**: Core tools for notebooks & data analysis.
* **Matplotlib**: The king of all python plotting packages.
* **Gensim**: Framework for vector modeling.
* **NLTK** & **Spacy**: Used for natural language processing.
* **NumPy**: Array processing tool.
* **Scikit-learn**: Modules for machine learning & data modeling.
* **SciPy**: Scientific library for python.
* **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualizer.
* **Pip** & **Setuptools**: package installer & version manager (Mac only).
* **PyMC**: common stats tool for simulation and optimization.
* **Sqlite**: Standalone, lightweight SQL database engine.
* **Statsmodels**: Simple statistical computation (used with SciPy).

## ADDITIONAL TOOLS
These tools aren't specifically required, but are highly recommended.

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) are popular text editors for writing scripts to process data, perform analysis, and create visualizations.
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is Google's popular web browser, and comes with a complete set of developer tools built-in.

## A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
Follow the guidelines below to ensure your machine is fully prepared for Data Science: 

#### System Requirements
Make sure your machine is running with administrator permissions and has **at least 10+ GB of free disk space**. We also recommend that you use a laptop with a **13-inch screen or larger** in order to do your best work. In our experience, *students with an 11-inch screen have a harder time in class*.

#### Mac Users
General Assembly is a Mac-friendly organization.  Our instructors will be teaching the course using Macs, so we strongly recommend students use a Mac with OS X 10.11 (“El Capitan”) in order to run all of the programs necessary for the course. **This rules out some older MacBooks.**

Check the following specs to make sure your machine can provide you with the performance you’ll need in this course:

* *1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor*
* *Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz*
* *Intel HD Graphics 6000*
* *At least 8GB RAM*
* *128GB flash storage*
* *10+ GB of free disk space*

#### PC Users
While you can be a data scientist with *any* machine, some students have found compatibility issues with older versions of Windows. While you can be a data scientist with any machine, unfortunately, there are a number of compatibility issues with Python libraries and older versions of Windows. For example, Python and Anaconda users have identified multiple issues with Windows 7 x64 machines. 

Therefore, we **strongly recommend** that PCs users adopt the latest version of Windows** (“Windows 10”). PC users on older machines may consider installing a Virtual Machine like [Oracle’s Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and running Anaconda in a Linux environment via [Ubuntu Desktop](http://www.ubuntu.com/download). [See more information here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/images).

Please note that our instructors will be conducting the course using Macs, and *may not be able to help PC or Linux users troubleshoot* any issues you might encounter. ***If you choose to use a PC or Linux machine, you will need to provide your own IT support.***

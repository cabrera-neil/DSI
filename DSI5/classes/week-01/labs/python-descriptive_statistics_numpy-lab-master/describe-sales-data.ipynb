The first paramter `data` is the only required parameter.  The other parameters in our example on line 3, control the visual aesthetics.  You can read more about [controling the visual aesthetics](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/aesthetics.html) of Seaborn.\n",

In this case, with the plot refernece to \"distplot\", it's possible to set the title using `.set_title`."

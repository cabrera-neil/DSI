    "> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common application for AR, ARMA, and ARIMA models is inventory planning. Planning inventory for a small shop can be difficult enough, but you've just been hired to plan inventory for a _big_ store - Walmart\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be analyzing weekly Walmart sales data over a two year period from 2010 to 2012. The data is separated by store and by department, but you should focus on analyzing one store for simplicity. Your supervisor has set out the following goals for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Record any observed trends in the data.\n",
    "1. Produce a trained model to predict future sales numbers.\n",
    "1. Include useful AND COMMENT ON how graphs (ACF, PACF) impact your modelling decisions throughout your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try your best to tune your model. It can be difficult, but don't worry - timeseries analysis is just a difficult and specialized topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assemble observations and graphs as well as timeseries models in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starter code\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "%matplotlib inline\n",
    "\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv('./datasets/train.csv')\n",
    "data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)\n",
    "data.head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable\n",

    "The \"Monty Hall Problem” is a famous statistical problem based on the game show \"Let's Make a Deal.\" (Monty Hall was the show’s original host.) \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't heard of this game show, no worries. We’ll break down the basics below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Let's Make a Deal\" features three doors labeled \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C.\" As the contestant, you are told that, behind exactly one door, there’s a new car. Behind the other two doors are goats. Your goal is to select the door with the car behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You select a door.\n",
    "2) The game show host, knowing which door hides the car, opens one of the doors you didn’t select to reveal a goat. (Important: If you selected a door with a goat, the host picks the other door with a goat. If you started by selecting the door with the car, the host picks from the remaining two doors at random.)\n",
    "3) The host then asks you if you would like to stick with the door you originally picked or switch to the other remaining door."

Based on your intuition, is it more advantageous to stick with your original choice, to switch to the remaining door, or does your probability of success not change?"

Each word is mapped to a feature with the use of a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), which converts it to a hash. If we encounter that word again in the text, it will be converted to the same hash, allowing us to count word occurrence without retaining a dictionary in memory.\n",

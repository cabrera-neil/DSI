> Unit 2, Activity 22

<!--- Unit and sequence information. This template is an instructor-facing description for a given activity or lab. --->

## Materials We Provide

<!--- This section is a table of contents for the activity. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between  notebooks and supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lab/Activity |  Structured Jupyter notebook with lab requirements | [Link](./eda-with-billboard-data-lab.ipynb)|
| Data | Local copy of any datasets used | [Link](./datasets/billboard.csv)|
| Solutions | Sample solutions to lab | [Link](./solution-code/student-example-solution.ipynb)|

> Dataset(s) description: The dataset contains data on all the songs that reached the top 200 Billboard listing for the year 2000. It is a large, dirty dataset that students should use to practice with Pandas and to learn how to perform EDA.

## Prerequisites

<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites; in other words, what do students need to know to be able to benefit and perform the tasks required in this activity/lab? List all relevant skills or prior learning objectives --->

**Before this activity, students should already be able to**:

- Explore CSVs using Pandas
- Make visualizations using Pandas plotting and / or `matplotlib`

---

## Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the activity or lab.  --->

This is an open-ended lab for students to get to know the Pandas library and get a feel for performing EDA. Other than a basic description of the data and a handful of minimum requirements, there is no structure to the lab.

<!--- This section lists the exact requirements students have to perform in order to "complete" the activity.  --->

### Requirements

- Use Pandas to read in your data
- Rename column names where appropriate
- Describe your data: check the value counts and descriptive statistics
- Make use of groupby statements
- Utilize Boolean sorting
- Assess the validity of your data (missing data, distributions?)

<!--- If there are any bonus objectives, list them here. Bonus objectives are items that are not officially required in order to "complete" a given activity, but are provided as suggested enrichment for students who want additional challenges.--->

### Bonus

- Produce a blog-post ready description of your lab
- State your assumptions about the data
- Describe limitations
- Consider how you can action this from a stakeholder perspective (radio, record label, fan)
- Include visualizations

## Suggested Timing

This lab is intentionally open-ended and has no formal structure. The minimum requirements can likely be met in as little as 15 minutes, but students are encouraged to spend as much time as they like taking a deep dive into the data and trying to glean insights.

<!--- This section outlines the lesson plan with relevant sections and subsections, providing both the total time required as well as suggestions for timing in each section --->
<!---
> Total Time Required: 90 min

- **Objective 1** (estimated: 20 mins)
- **Objective 2** (estimated: 30 mins)
- **Objective 3** (estimated: 40 mins)

> Note: If this lab or activity is not finished in-class, we recommend completing it as homework.

## Rubric

For this activity, required objectives will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 1-3.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations._
**3** | _Exceeds expectations!_

> Note: Bonus objectives = exceed expectations.

## Additional Resources

<!--- List of potential sources that may help or inform the students' ability to complete the tasks required. This might include reference sites, examples, or tutorials for "getting started." --->

## Materials We Provide

<!--- This section is a table of contents for the activity. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between  notebooks and supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

## Prerequisites

<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites; in other words, what do students need to know to be able to benefit and perform the tasks required in this activity/lab? List all relevant skills or prior learning objectives --->

**Before this activity, students should already be able to**:

- Formulate a problem statement / hypothesis about a dataset
- Use pandas grouping / subsetting / segmentation
- Calculate and plot summary statistics
  - Histograms
  - Scatter plots
- Clean data
  - Assess valid types
  - Convert corrupted values
  - Remov invalid data
- Examine potential outliers and limitations of a dataset

## Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the activity or lab.  --->

Students get to practice exploring data and finding insights, as well as working in teams. Each team has specific objectives:

### Team Alpha Drone

- Explore the drone strike data and describe it
- Do some accompanying research to augment your analysis
- Report back any good summary statistics
- Evaluate whether the data data is a good source

### Team Popcorn

- Report metrics that will help...
  - Sell movie ideas to potential investors
  - Maximize product placement and / or sponsorships

### Team Titanic

Explore the relationships between variables in the dataset. Which variables seem to be related, which are unrelated? Are there surprises when you look at different cross-sections of the data?

### Team Silk Road

- Invent some quality metric(s) to help measure crypto-currencies
- Project any kind of lifetime of given market
- Volatility
- Impact of "mine-ability" of any of the above
- Answer this question: If one were to open or operate an illegal marketplace, which currency choice is best?

<!--- This section lists the exact requirements students have to perform in order to "complete" the activity.  --->

### Requirements

1. Objective 1
2. Objective 2
3. Objective 3

--->
<!--- If there are any bonus objectives, list them here. Bonus objectives are items that are not officially required in order to "complete" a given activity, but are provided as suggested enrichment for students who want additional challenges.--->

## Suggested Timing

<!--- This section outlines the lesson plan with relevant sections and subsections, providing both the total time required as well as suggestions for timing in each section --->

> Total Time Required: Full day

## Rubric

For this activity, required objectives will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 1-3.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations._
**3** | _Exceeds expectations!_

> Note: Bonus objectives = exceed expectations.

> Unit 1, Activity 5

<!--- Unsure what to put for activity number here. In DSI Curriculum v2.2 guide, this is simply 1.05, but it is also the first lab / activity.
>

<!--- Unit and sequence information. This template is an instructor-facing description for a given activity or lab. --->

## Materials We Provide

<!--- This section is a table of contents for the activity. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between  notebooks and supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lab/Activity |  Structured Jupyter notebook with activity requirements and prompts | [Link](./python-functions.ipynb)|
| Solutions | Sample solutions to lab | [Link](./solution-code/python-functions-solutions.ipynb)|

## Prerequisites

<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites; in other words, what do students need to know to be able to benefit and perform the tasks required in this activity/lab? List all relevant skills or prior learning objectives --->

**Before this activity, students should already be able to**:

- Know python data types: string, int, float, boolean, tuple, list, dictionary
- Be able to implement control flow
- Be able to define and execute a function in python

---

## Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the activity or lab.  --->

Students will define and execute several simple functions in order to reinforce understanding of basic python / functions syntax.

<!--- This section lists the exact requirements students have to perform in order to "complete" the activity.  --->

### Requirements

1. Write a function that takes the length of a side of a square as an argument and returns the area of the square
2. Write a function that takes the heigth and width of a triangle and returns the area.
3. Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a tuple consisting of two elements
4. Write a function that takes two integers, passed as strings, and returns the sum, difference, and product as a tuple (all values as integers)
5. Write a function that takes a list as the argument and returns a tuple consisting of two elements
    - A list with the items in reverse order
    - A list of the items in the original list that have an odd index

<!--- If there are any bonus objectives, list them here. Bonus objectives are items that are not officially required in order to "complete" a given activity, but are provided as suggested enrichment for students who want additional challenges.--->

### Bonus

6. Write a function that returns the score for a word. The score of the word is the sum of the scores of its letters. Each letter's score is equal to it's position in the alphabet

> Total Time Required: 75 min

- **Requirement 1** (estimated: 5 mins)
- **Requirement 2** (estimated: 10 mins)
- **Requirement 3** (estimated: 10 mins)
- **Requirement 4** (estimated: 10 mins)
- **Requirement 5** (estimated: 20 mins)
- **Requirement 6** (estimated: 20 mins)

> Note: If this lab or activity is not completed in-class, we recommend assigning it as homework.

## Rubric

For this activity, required objectives will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 1-3.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations._
**3** | _Exceeds expectations!_

> Note: Bonus objectives = exceeds expectations.

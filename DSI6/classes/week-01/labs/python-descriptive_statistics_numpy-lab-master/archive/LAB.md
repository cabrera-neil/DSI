## ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Describing Sales Data with Python and Numpy


> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

From previous days you're already familiar with:

- Fundamental Python concepts
- Iteration and looping
- Manipulation of dictionaries and lists
- Functions
- Numpy and Scipy statistics functions
- List comprehensions
- Reading in csv files with Python
- Basic statistical concepts on descriptive statistics and distributions

In this lab you're going to combine everything we've learned so far!

#### Requirements

[Starter code]('./describe-sales-data.ipynb')

- Load the "sales_data.csv" with python
- Construct a dictionary version of the data, with keys as column names and values as column data
- Write a function to describe measures of central tendency and measures of variance for the data
- Plot the data distributions and think about the skewness (or symmetry) of the data!

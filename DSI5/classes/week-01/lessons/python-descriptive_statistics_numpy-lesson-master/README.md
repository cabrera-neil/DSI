## Materials We Provide

<!--- This section is a table of contents for the lesson. The table structure breaks down typical lesson resources into types, distinguishing between lesson notebooks and other supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

## Learning Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the lesson. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, see: http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/ --->

*After this lessons, students will be able to:*

- Understand the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode).
- Understand how mean, median and mode are affected by skewness in data.
- Understand measures of variability (variance and standard deviation).

## Student Requirements

<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites; in other words, what do students need to know to be able to benefit and perform the tasks required in this lesson? This includes lists of skills or prior learning objectives --->

*Before this lesson(s), students should already have:*

- Watched Lesson 3: Estimation in [Intro to Stats](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101) (This should've been completed as pre-work before starting the course).

## Lesson Outline

<!--- This section outlines the lesson plan with relevant sections and subsections, providing both the total time required as well as suggestions for timing in each subsection --->

> **Total Time: 135 min**

I. **Foundations** (90 min total)

- Opening: Descriptive Statistics vs. Inferential Statistics (15 min)
- Measures of Central Tendency (30 min)
  - Mean (5 min)
  - Median (10 min)
  - Mode (10 min)
  - All three using `scipy` (5 min)
- Skewness (15 min)
  - Overview (10 min)
  - Codealong (5 min)
- Measures of Dispersion (30 min)
  - Range (10 min)
  - Variance (10 min)
  - Standard Deviation (10 min)

II. **Applications** (45 min total)

- [Independent Practice](./practice/measures-of-central-tendency-practice.ipynb)

---

<!--- If a repo contains any additional practice files or supplementary resources (PDFs, etc) describe them here  --->

> OPTIONAL: Practice/Resources
- [Independent practice notebook](./practice/measures-of-central-tendency-practice.ipynb) has students calculate several statistics like mean, median, range, and variance, independently using `numpy` and `scipy`
- [Lying with Stats](./slides/lying-with-statistics.pdf) is a good slideshow with activities to introduce students to the differences between various statistics and their uses.

## Additional Resources

<!--- This section lists useful reference materials that can inform, extend, or deepen a student's understanding of the material. While this may seem like a "nice to have" feature, we normally see a range of advanced and remedial students in our classes. Curating these resources allows us to provide targeted materials and suggestions that instructors can use to support different student needs. --->

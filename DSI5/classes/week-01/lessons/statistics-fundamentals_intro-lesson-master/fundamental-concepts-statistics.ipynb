    "Before we work with data, we must consider how it will be collected. It is important to collect data in a theoretically proper manner and, in your analysis, account for the \"real-world\" issues that will naturally arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often expensive, time-consuming, and, in some cases, impossible to take measurements of every person or observation of interest. In order to overcome this reality, statisticians have developed a variety of methods to collect data from a subset of the population of interest in an intentional manner and then extrapolate those findings to the larger group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking broadly, in statistics we take measurements from a sample to learn about a broader population. We must, however, be *very* careful about how we define this population, as any inferences we make based on a sample can only be extended to the sampled population.\n",

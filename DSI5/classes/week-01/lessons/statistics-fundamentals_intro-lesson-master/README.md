## Materials We Provide

<!--- This section is a table of contents for the lesson. The table structure breaks down typical lesson resources into types, distinguishing between lesson notebooks and other supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->

## Learning Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the lesson. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, see: http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/ --->

*After this lessons, students will be able to:*

- Define target population, sampled population, sample, sampling unit, observation unit, sampling frame, probability sampling, and non-probability sampling, and identify these within the context of a real-world situation.
- Differentiate between descriptive and inferential statistics.
- Calculate, interpret, and apply properties of univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics.

## Student Requirements

<!--- This section explains the relevant prerequisites; in other words, what do students need to know to be able to benefit and perform the tasks required in this lesson? This includes lists of skills or prior learning objectives --->

*Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:*

1. Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency
2. Calculate and interpret measures of spread
3. Explain and interpret skew

<!--- If a repo contains any additional practice files or supplementary resources (PDFs, etc) describe them here  --->

## Additional Resources

<!--- This section lists useful reference materials that can inform, extend, or deepen a student's understanding of the material. While this may seem like a "nice to have" feature, we normally see a range of advanced and remedial students in our classes. Curating these resources allows us to provide targeted materials and suggestions that instructors can use to support different student needs. --->

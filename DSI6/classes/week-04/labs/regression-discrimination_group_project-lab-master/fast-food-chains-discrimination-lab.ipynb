    "# Fast Food Chains and Price Discrimination\n",
    "\n",

    "This group lab uses a 1994 data set of detailed prices on items sold at more than 400 Burger King, Wendy's, KFC, and [Roy Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Rogers_Restaurants) restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is a restricted version of the data set used in this publication:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [K. Graddy (1997), \"Do Fast-Food Chains Price Discriminate on the Race and Income Characteristics of an Area?\" Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 15, 391-401](http://people.brandeis.edu/~kgraddy/published%20papers/GraddyK_jbes1997.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of this exercise is to evaluate whether or not fast food restaurants are using discriminatory pricing.** This is a fairly open-ended prompt. It's up to you to determine how to quantify pricing discrimination using the following groups of variables:\n",
    "- The price of fast food items, which can be a metric of discriminatory practices.\n",
    "- The proportion of African Americans residents, low-income residents, and residents without a car.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### In Groups, You Should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Load and examine the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Perform any necessary data cleaning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Conduct an exploratory data analysis relevant to the goals of the project.** What variables are you interested in for your target(s) and predictors? What types of relationships do you see in the data that will inform your analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Formulate and formally define your hypotheses.** Based on the prompt and your EDA, come up with a plan for testing each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Construct regression models to test each hypothesis.** What are your findings? Do they support the hypothesis? What are the limitations and assumptions of your approach? \n",
    "\n",
    "6) **[Bonus] Cross-validate the results of your regression.** If the results support your hypotheses, do they hold up during cross-validation or a train/test split?\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **Prepare a brief (10-minute) presentation on the findings.** Each group's presentation should include your questions, models, and findings.\n",
    "    - Be concise! Only include relevant information in your presentation.\n",
    "    - Visuals are nice, but don't overdo it.\n",
    "    - Don't just talk about your model's significance or metrics. Interpret the coefficients. What are the implications?\n",
    "    - What future hypotheses could you test going forward?\n",
    "\n",
